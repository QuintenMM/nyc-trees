#TODO : Pull in the dataset
#TODO : clean the dataset
'''
   - The dataset contains no missing values ("" or null)
   - No duplicates.
   - Values are consolidated
   - Data format is correct
   - No blank spaces (ex: " I love python " => "I love python")
   -- sidetrack: The more rows of data you use, the better. However, pay attention that the more data you have, the longer each operation needs to execute.
'''
#TODO : extra checks
'''
- Can values be consolidated? (e.g. Truck and truck refer to the same thing)
- Are there some columns where most of the data is missing ?
- Can you fill in some missing values ?
- Is the date format correct?
- Are some values integers that should be float or vice-versa ? Change the dtype.
